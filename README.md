go.geo
======

Go.geo is a geometry/geography libary in [Go](http://golang.org). Its purpose is to allow for
basic point, line and path operations in the context of online mapping.

This code is still in version 0.1, but has worked well for a few of my side projects.

TODO:

* Expand this readme
* Write some more tests
